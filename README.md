# PowerBi_dashboard_project
This is a complete End to end Dashboard Project using Power bi and SQL on Hotel Reservation dataset.
In this dashboard following problems are solved:
1)- Is our hotel growing by year?
(We have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type)
2)- Should we increase our parking lot size?
We want to understand if there is a trend is guest with personal cars.
3)-What trends can we see in the data?
Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality.
